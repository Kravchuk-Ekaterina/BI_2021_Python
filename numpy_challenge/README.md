# Numpy homework
I created numpy_challenge.py which contains 3 arrays created in different ways and the following functions:

1) matrix_multiplication: takes 2 matrices, multiplies them according to the appropriate rules and outputs the resulting matrix
2) multiplication_check: takes a list of matrices, and returns 'True' if they can be multiplied by each other in the order in which they are in the list, and 'False' if they cannot be multiplied
3) multiply_matrices: takes a list of matrices and returns the result of the multiplication if it can be obtained, or returns None if it cannot be multiplied
4) compute_2d_distance: takes 2 one-dimensional arrays with a pair of values (as coordinates of a point on a plane) and calculates the distance between them
5) compute_multidimensional_distance: accepts 2 one-dimensional arrays with any number of values (but equal) and calculates the distance between them
6) compute_pair_distances: gets 2d array where each row is an observation and each column is a feature. The function calculates a matrix of pairwise distances and displays it to the user
