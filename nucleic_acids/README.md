# Homework 1
Here you can find a programm nucleic_acids.py to work with nucleic acids. You can use the following commands:

1) transcribe - print the transcribed sequence
2) reverse - print the reverse sequence
3) complement - print the complement sequence
4) reverse complement - print the reverse complement sequence
5) count bases - print the number of each base in the sequence
6) base content - print the content of each base
7) gc content - print the gc-content 
8) exit - finish you work with the programm

The programm will ask you to enter the command and then to enter the sequence. If the input is not correct, please, try again.

The programm will work until you enter the command 'exit'
